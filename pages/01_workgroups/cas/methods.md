## Main Research Topics of our Group

### Image acquisition

- imaging of the inner ear and the lateral skull base
- imaging of cochlear implants after insertion

### Image processing and software development

- visualization and processing of medical images
- manually and semi-automated segmentation
- trajectory planning
- bone thickness calculation and visualization
- visualization of cochlear anatomy using rotating midmodiolar slice planes
- software development using C++, VTK, ITK, Matlab, Mathematica, LabView

### 3D modelling

- anatomica models of the lateral skull base and the surgical approach
- finite element models of the human inner ear and the electrode array
- physicial replica of the human inner ear (artificial cochlear model)

### Medical device development and evaluation 

-  surgical assistance devices for minimally invasive cochlear implantation surgery
-  surgical tools and medical devices such as
   +  image-guided surgery systems
   +  micro-stereotactic frames (surgical templates)
   +  manual and automated insertion tools
   +  drilling tools

### CI electrode development

- functionalization (shape memory inlays, fluid-mechanical actuators, tubular manipulators,...)
- individualization (length, thickness, shape change,...)
- virtual prototyping using finite element analysis
- simulation and optimization of the individual insertion process

### CI electrode characterization

-  using 3D bending test
-  determination of curling behavior
-  manual and automated insertion tests in 
   +  artificial cochlea models and 
   +  human temporal bone specimens
-  investigation of insertion forces and their correlation to
   +  insertion speed
   +  shape and size of the inner ear
-  histology and evaluation of insertion trauma
