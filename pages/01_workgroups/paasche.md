title: Paasche Lab - Electrode-Neural-Interface
***


The research group „Electrode Neural Interface“ works mainly on two different topics:

1.	Optimization of the interface between electrode contacts and the surrounding tissue. 
This includes not only work with cell lines and primary cells from the inner ear for testing biocompatibility and the influence of any surface modifications (e.g. structures or coatings), but also the transfer into products (with partners) and their evaluation (e.g. influence of surface modifications on insertion forces during implantation) but also investigation of the impedance development in patients.
2.	Development and testing of stents for the Eustachian tube for the treatment of middle ear ventilation disorders. It also includes testing materials, to develop and establish models for testing of prototypes and its translation together with industrial partners.
