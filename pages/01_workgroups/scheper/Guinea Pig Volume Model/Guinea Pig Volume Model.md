# Optimization of pharmacological interventions in the guinea pig animal model – a new approach to calculate the perilymph volume of the scala tympani

Here we provide the model to calculate the volume of the guinea pig scala tympani and an inserted cochlear implant electrode array for free download and use. The model was developed and validated based on a set of 42 un-implanted and 15 implanted guinea pig cochleae, allows for the application of coatings onto the electrode array and is hence particularly well suited for pharmacokinetic studies[^1],

The software is Matlab-based, made for Windows PCs and can be run if the corresponding version of the Matlab Runtime Engine (R2018a) is installed. The Runtime Engine can be downloaded for free at [MATLAB Runtime - MATLAB Compiler – MATLAB]. (https://de.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) 
Please cite the paper[^1] if the model is used for studies, and don’t hesitate to get in touch with us if there are any issues, e.g. by contacting the lead author Marleen Grzybowski [grzybowski.marleen@mh-hannover.de](grzybowski.marleen@mh-hannover.de) or Dr. Daniel Schurzig [Schurzig.daniel@mh-hannover.de](Schurzig.daniel@mh-hannover.de).
