DeHoCI Simulator ver 0.0 is a software tool that can be used by any professional in the field of Cochlear Implants to understand how a cochlear implant works. DeHoCI offers the possibility to simulate the sound a cochlear implant user perceives. Sound is synthesized from the electrical patterns delivered by a Cochlear Implant device.

Additionally DeHoCI incorporates a simulator of the electrical field and the auditory nerve in the cochlea  that allows the visualization of stimulation patterns.

This software tool has been implemented in MATLAB unfortunately, but still can be run as a standalone application.
