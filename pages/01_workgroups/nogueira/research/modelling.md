# Topics:

---

##  3D FEM Model of a Human Cochlea and a Cochlear Implant
- 3D finite element method (FEM) models of human cochleae to simulate the voltage distribution in the cochlea when stimulating with a cochlear implant (CI)
- The 3D model can be customized based on landmarks from CBCT imaging data to represent individual patients
- Voltage distributions can be used to study the activation of the auditory nerve by a CI

##  3D FEM Model of Auditory Nerve and Auditory Nerve Implant
- 3D FEM model of a human cochlea and auditory nerve to predict the voltage spread with the novel auditory nerve implant (ANI)
- The ANI delivers intraneural stimulation to the auditory nerve through penetrating electrodes   

---

## Auditory Nerve Fiber models
- Phenomenological and physiological models of auditory nerve fibers stimulated acoustically, electrically, or with **[electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS)](https://vianna.de/01_workgroups/nogueira/research/eas.html)**
- Neuron models can be coupled to FEM models for realistic current input

## Electrophysiology and Neural Health
- Models of neural degeneration to study the effect on thresholds, evoked potentials, or signal transmission 
- A model of the acoustically or electrically evoked compound action potential (aCAP/eCAP) measured through intracochlear electrodes  

---

## Auditory Experiments Simulations
- Computational models to simulate performance of cochlea implant users in different auditory experiments
- Objective measurements of speech intelligibility from neural spike activity
