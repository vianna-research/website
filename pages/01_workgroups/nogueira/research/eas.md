# EAS-Masking

veryday more people with residual hearing receive cochlear implants (CIs) to obtain electroacoustic stimulation (EAS), i.e. combined auditory stimulation delivered electrically from CI electrodes and acoustically through a hearing aid (HA). For EAS users low frequency acoustic hearing produces almost no recognition for speech in noise, but the performance is significantly enhanced when combined with the electric hearing delivered by the CI. However, it is still unknown how the acoustic and electric stimulation modalities interact with each other. Clinical experience has found that some EAS users do not use the HA at all and rely solely on electric stimulation. Moreover, it has been observed that EAS users require more time to achieve their maximum performance with the CI alone than regular CI users. These limitations may have influence in defining the implantation criteria of EAS. Possible explanations for these limitations are interactions between acoustic and electric stimulation. These interactions become more and more important for people with large residual hearing because the overlap between electric and acoustic stimulation is larger. For example, it has been shown that the range of hearing loss for which EAS devices are prescribed is getting closer to the range of age related hearing loss. Age related hearing loss, as EAS, is characterized by lost of audibility in the high frequencies.

Given that the population in Europe is becoming older with increased hearing loss related problems new treatments are required to rehabilitate people with age related hearing loss. Cognitive decline and hearing loss seem to be related and new treatments such as EAS are very promising to improve quality of life of the elderly population. This work is about characterizing the interaction between acoustic and electric stimulation.

The characterization will consist of psychophysical, electrophysiological, imaging and backward telemetry measures in EAS users. Psychophysically, the acoustic and electric interaction will be measured by means of simultaneous or forward masking experiments. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) for each study participant will be used to assess the insertion depth and electrode positions. Electrical field imaging (EFI) from the backward telemetry of the implant will be used to characterize the electrode neuron interface, and finally electrocochleography (eChochG) measures will be used to assess the overlap between acoustic and electric stimulation at the neural level. The outcomes of this project are datasets, fitting procedures and a model characterizing the interaction between acoustic and electric stimulation of each EAS user. These outcomes have application to optimize the configuration of EAS devices and to assess whether the indication for EAS implantation can be potentially extended to people with age related hearing loss.

# EAS-Modeling

Thanks to recent improvements in the cochlear implant (CI) surgical technique and the electrode design, it is now often possible to preserve residual acoustic hearing in the low frequencies during the insertion of a CI in the same ear.
CI users with preserved low frequency hearing receive combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) and show improved speech performance scores especially in noisy situations when compared to CI users without preserved residual hearing.
 
However, it has been shown that simultaneous acoustic and electric stimulation causes interactions between both modalities. One form of such interaction is masking. Masking between electric and acoustic stimulation has been observed in
auditory nerve fiber (ANF) spike trains in animals as well as in electrocochleographic (ECochG) responses and psychophysical experiments in humans (see Project EAS-Masking). To date, it remains unclear at which stage of the auditory pathway
these masking effects arise (i.e. at the level of hair cells, the auditory nerve, or more centrally).

In this project, we develop a computational model of the acoustically and electrically stimulated auditory nerve to better understand the underlying interaction mechanisms in EAS users. Existing models simulate ANF spiking for sole acoustic 
or electric stimulation. Our idea is to couple a model of acoustically evoked spiking activity with a model of electrically induced spikes to simulate the electric-acoustically stimulated auditory nerve. Our current implementation shows 
appropriate spiking responses to both acoustic stimulations of remaining hair cells and electric stimulation of the ANF, as well as inhibitory interaction between both modalities.

# Binaural Fusion between Electric and Acoustic Stimulation in Bimodal CI subjects

Bimodal stimulation consisting of electric stimulation with a cochlear implant (CI) and acoustic stimulation with a contralateral hearing aid (HA), can improve speech perception in noise.  Currently at the Hannover Medical School more than 70% of the new CI implanted subjects has some sort of residual hearing on the contralateral ear of the CI. However, large variability in benefits with bimodal listening has been observed with some individuals even experiencing interference with this type of stimulation. This variability has been associated to binaural fusion between the CI and the HA. This work is about characterizing the basic mechanisms that provide binaural fusion between electric and acoustic stimulation in bimodal CI users through basic psychoacoustic and electrophysiological measures. Based on the fundamental understanding of bimodal fusion, this project investigates novel CI fittings to improve fusion between electric and acoustic stimulation. The evaluation of the CI fittings will be evaluated by means of a novel cortical electrophysiological measure and through behavioural measures to assess the benefit of bimodal input.
