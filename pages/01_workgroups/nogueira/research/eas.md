title: Electric Acoustic Stimulation

![EAS](modelling.png){.img-rounded; .float:left}

# Psychoacoustics in EAS users
* Investigation of psychoacoustic electric-acoustic masking for combined EAS
* The effect of ES on acoustic hearing if electric and acoustic stimuli are presented simultaneously.
* The effect of AS on electric hearing if electric and acoustic stimuli are presented simultaneously.

# Electrophysiological measurements in EAS users
* Electrophysiological measurements are used to examine electric-acoustic interaction in EAS users.
* Telemetry capabilities of the CI systems are used to derive intracochlear electrocochleography in EAS users.
* Cochlear microphonic (CM) and auditory nerve neurophonic (ANN) potentials, recorded in response to AS, ES, and in response to combined EAS are used to determine peripheral electric-acoustic interaction electrophysiologically.

# Sound coding for EAS users
* Development and evaluation of sound coding for EAS users conveying low-frequency information of speech electrically to improve the speech perception for ES alone.
* Investigation of EAS fittings to optimize speech perception for EAS users.

# Computational modeling for EAS
* Development of 3D models of the cochlea for ES and EAS
* Models of neural coding in auditory nerve fibers in response to ES, AS, and EAS
* Models of electrophysiological responses such as the electrically or acoustically evoked compound action potential to investigate the effect of electric-acoustic interaction on these measures
* Neural networks to emulate psychoacoustic experiments or speech perception of EAS users in different neural health conditions

# Binaural fusion of electric-acoustic stimulation 
* Investigation of central electic acoustic interaction through speech understanding performance and cortical EEG measurements;
* Investigataion of peripheral electric acoustic interaction through electric-acoustic pitch matching and measurment of auditory brainstem responses; 
* Optimization of the CI fitting  using the measurements of central and peripheral electric acoustic interaction.
