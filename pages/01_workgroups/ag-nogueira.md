The Auditory Prosthetic Group of the German Hearing Center, part of the Medical University Hannover conducts research in signal processing and auditory modelling applied to implantable hearing prostheses including cochlear implants and hybrid electroacoustic stimulation devices. The group is very interdisciplinary covering fields of acoustics, signal processing, auditory models and psychophysics.

The group started in September 2013 as part of the Excellence Cluster Hearing4all.
