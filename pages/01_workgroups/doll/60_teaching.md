## Polymerbased microfabrication techniques for implants

Mikrokunstofffertigungstechnik für Implantate

### Content

This lecture provides physico-chemical basics and overview of manufacturing components for biomedical use. Essentials for the succesfull integration of implants are their  assessment and biocompatibility. Materials and manufacturing processes are introduced. Each lectures includes one  material and correlationg finilazition techniques for  specific implants and medical products.
By means of these examples, requirements for material selection and usability can be established and understood.
Tutorials include researching and exercises about biofunctionality which are discusses in class.

## Joint Lecture: Biomechanics - Inhalation - Neurorehabilitation

### Content: 
This lecture introduces into the field of the peripheral neural system. It starts with the mechanic requirements of the striated sceletal muscles, adds exemplarily the smooth muscles and disembogues into the requirements of the overlying neural loops of control. The lecture ends up with today's approaches to technically restore such functions in the disabled / severly injured.

## Nanotechnology in Medicine
Nanotechnologie in der Medizin

### Content:


"Nano" has been one of the most used buzz words in the last decade. Lots has been promised and many useful things habe been developed. Many ideas, however, that have already stimulated the "microsystem" decade, have been revived like Heuberger's submarine: This would remove plaque from the inner side of blood vessels and went "nano" - still promised by serious researchers.

The course "Nanotechnology in Medicine" wants to review all nano-developments that found interest in medicine in a critical way. A review is given on current developements in this specific science. The technical topics will comprise the mecial use of nanomaterials:

* Diagnostic and medical devices
* Neuro-electronic interfaces woth both refueling strategies
* Medical applications of molecular nanotechnologiy as well as
* nanorobots and cell repair machines

Based on this, we want to develop tools and techniques for the assessment of "nano" ideas in the terms of feasability. Techniques are learned for setting up research roadmaps with definition oc challenges and hurdles.
