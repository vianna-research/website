title: Artificial Cochlea Models
status: hidden

Dear Visitors,

Thanks for your interest in our models of the uncoiled human scala tympani as desribed in Schurzig _et al._ 2021[^1]. Please find below links to ZIP-files containing the two models (as STEP-files) mentioned in the paper. 

[Link to i-path model](01_workgroups/cas/methods/cochlearmodelling/uncoiled_st_ipath.zip) and [Link to oc-path model](01_workgroups/cas/methods/cochlearmodelling/uncoiled_st_ocpath.zip)

| <font size = "3"> **Figure 2**: CAD (computer-aided design) model generation in SolidWorks: (**A**) spiral models were generated with the loft feature using cross-sectional information in 22.5° steps, whereas (**B**) straight models uncoiled along a specific trajectory (solid black line) were created based on cross-sectional information in 1 mm intervals along this trajectory. </font> | **Figure 4**: (**A**) visualization of insertion (in red) and OC (in blue) paths inside the ST, (**B**) the length of these paths along the cochlear spiral including an exemplary visualization of three cochlear sections. (**C**) Visualization of these cochlear sections in the CAD model and (**D**) a depiction of all sectional volumes along the insertion and OC paths. |
